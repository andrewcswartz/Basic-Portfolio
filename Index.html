        My name is Andrew Swartz and I haved in Chicago for the past 3 years. Before that I lived in San Francisco and Houston Texas for about a year. I have spent the vast majority of my professional career in the Rail industry working for companies from leasing and terminal management to my current company which has a nationwide repair network. Outside of one year in operations I have spent the rest of the time in accounting and finance roles. I am a CPA with a Masters degree from St. Louis University and an Undergraduate degree from the Kansas State University (EMAW!!).
